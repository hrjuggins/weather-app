## Improvements
- I feel like I can improve on the progress bar animation, potentially adding a motion effect on the bar.
- I would like for the countdown timer to be more dependant on the 60 second data refresh. Currently they are running as separate setIntervals, which could lead to issues of the getting out of sync.
- Adding unit/ integration tests to the project would be useful to ensure that we are handling all potential errors.
